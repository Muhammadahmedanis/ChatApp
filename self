This code means:
ðŸ‘‰ When this component mounts (like the Profile page), it dispatches the me thunk (which calls the GET /auth/me API).

ðŸ’¡ Why is it triggered?
Because you probably have this code inside the Profile.jsx or similar component.

So when you navigate to the Profile page:

That component mounts.

useEffect runs.

dispatch(me()) is executed.

Redux Toolkit async thunk me calls your backend's /auth/me API.

When the response comes back, it updates state.userProfile.
